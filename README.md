# Repeat After Me (Simon Says)

![RepeatAfterMe](https://i.imgur.com/FVXiFUg.png)

A simple JS canvas game made to help myself become better at writing cleaner JS. Also used TypeScript to learn what benefits it brings (I now love TypeScript).

It's just a simple Simon Says clone. If you don't know what it is look at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Says).

Play the game [on my website](https://www.harveydelaney.com/repeatafterme)

## Development
Run the following:

1. `npm install`
2. `webpack`

You'll need to run `webpack` everytime you make a change. I haven't had the chance to introduce live reloading yet.
